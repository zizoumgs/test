2.1.1 Defining Text Strings
There are a few ways to indicate a string in a PHP program. The simplest is to surround the string with single quotes:

print 'I would like a bowl of soup.';

print 'chicken';

print '06520';

print '"I am eating dinner," he growled.';
	</p>
	<h3>Your php should like following </h3>
	<?php
print 'I would like a bowl of soup.';

print 'chicken';

print '06520';

print '"I am eating dinner," he growled.';
?>
